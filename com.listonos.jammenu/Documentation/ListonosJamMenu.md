# Listonos' Jam Menu

Listonos' Jam Menu is a scaffolding for game dev jam projects that includes simple main menu, options and credits screens. It comes in two flavors, one with audio system and one without.

## Usage

Duplicate one of the provided scenes found in `Assets/Scenes`, depending on whether you want one with audio or not, and change titles and visual elements to your liking. There are asserts present in the code base that should guide you towards mandatory script properties that should be filled.

In order to use the audio flavor of the Jam Menu you will need to manually install Listonos' Audio System Unity package, as it is optional functionality.
