# Listonos' buttons

## Usage

Simply grab the prefabs from `Assets/Prefabs` and use them somewhere in UI hierarchy under UI Canvas object.

Note that if you want to disable buttons - i.e. cannot be clicked and are greyed out - through scripts, use the `Listonos.Buttons.Button.Interactible` property instead of the underlying Unity `Button.interactable`.
